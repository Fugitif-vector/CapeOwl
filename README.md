### [+] Note !!!
When a brute force attack is performed on an account, access to that account is temporarily disabled after a certain number of incorrect attempts. It's a security measure that you can't do anything about. 

Once account access is disabled, Cape-Owl will let you know and stop the process. 
You can relaunch it later, but before, remember to delete the words already tested in the word list.
